Namek is a planet in a trinary star system located at coordinates 9045XY within the
 Universe 7. It is the home planet of the Nameless Namekian, and Dende, along with other Namekians. 
The planet was destroyed by the wrath of Frieza on December 24, Age 762. The Namekian
 people were relocated to New Namek after being refugees on Earth for roughly a year. 

Characteristics

The planet had a population of about 100 Namekians at the time of the Vegeta Saga in 
November of Age 762. It is also home to a host of ambient life, such as fish, frogs, slugs and dinosaurs. 
Namek has three suns, so it is never night time. Despite this, depictions of the planet show 
there to be a dark side. It is possible that the planet is tidally locked to the star group, resulting 
in the lack of a day/night cycle, with the Nameks living on the daylight side of the planet.
 A Namekian year is much shorter than an earth year, at 130 days long, as shown when the 
Namekians are reviving the Z Fighters who died fighting Nappa. As measured by Bulma on 
arrival, the Namekian atmosphere does partly consist of oxygen. The Namekians could use
 this for their respiration process. 

Namekian Race

In planet Namek the living creatures in this location are quite interesting, these nice friendly 
creatures are called Namekians, they survive off of water and vegetables, Namekians also
 have the abilities to regenerate, extend any parts of their bodies, hear from a very long mile 
away, transform into a class meter 10-15 giant similar centimeters to Great Apes and not only 
they have those type of abilities, they can zap anything and desigh it how they want it to be 
with their antannae and the last but not least, they have the ability to heal/regenerate any down 
or physical hurt/injured allies.
